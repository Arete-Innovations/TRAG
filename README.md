# TRAG Bootstrapper

TRAG Boostraper is a cross distribution script that brings a fresh installation to a workable, usable system that can run a server out of the box. It should be run as root as it handles user creation itself. 

Currently it requires cloning the repository then running ```trag.sh```, but only ```curl```-ing ```trag.sh``` and executing it is a work in progress.
Please make sure your keyring is valid before running.

Supported Distributions:
1. Arch - Fully implemented
2. Debian - In development | Should work
3. Alpine - Planned

TRAG Bootstrapper also supports installing a development environment designed for day-to-day use on Arch. Support for other distributions is not currently planned in this regard.
